    "# A motivating example\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the fact that model interpretation suffers from faithfulness and fragility issues (and also people's overtrust of the interpretation), it is still useful to enforce prior knowledge. Feature attribution tools often assume that features are interpretable. This makes them less applicable when raw features are complicated (say in the image or audio domain). Thus, a lot of recent research effort have been poured in to explanation with high level concepts. Among them is this idea of concept bottleneck network (CBM). In this work, we expose the flaw of CBM and suggest a simple fix.\n",

    "$Z \\sim N(0, I_{2}))$ are 2 latent concepts\n",

    "\n",
    "$Y = \\theta Z$ where $\\theta$ is the true coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup will fail raw feature attribution (because $X$ distribute concepts across dimensions), concept discovery (when the function is a \"or\" concept), jointly trained concept (because $C$ has 1 less dimension off $Z$)."
