* ICBM stands for Incomplete Concept Bottleneck Model

It aims to

a) address issues with CBM when concept set is incomplete
b) leverage feature based attribution methods for high level features

[[credibility.ipynb][credibility.ipynb]] contains ideas to extend rationale from binary to real number

Two main messages:
1. Extend credible model to tasks with not interpretable raw features
   (eg. latent factors such as angle and others)
2. Extend binary risk factors to multiple real valued medial knowledge
