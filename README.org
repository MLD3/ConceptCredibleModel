* CCM stands for credible concept model

It aims to

a) address issues with CBM when concept set is incomplete
b) leverage feature based attribution methods for high level features

[[credibility.ipynb][credibility.ipynb]] contains ideas to extend rationale from binary to real number

Three ideas:
1. Extend credible model to tasks with not interpretable raw features
   (eg. latent factors such as angle and others)
2. Extend binary risk factors to multiple real valued medial knowledge
3. Expand interpretability to multimodality context: e.g. image to caption
   translation can be used for explanation (in some context words are better for
   explanation, in other context image may be the better medium for explanation)

Google slides for those ideas are tracked in [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12z6bVIWCeoK-vYjLjFkWsk00FOjvtsgjV03zM-15uI0/edit#slide=id.gc30c2b4595_0_68][here]].
